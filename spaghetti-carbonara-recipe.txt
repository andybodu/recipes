Ingredients (for two people):
200gr Spaghetti per person
A handful of pancetta or guanciale 
Small chopped onion
Two Eggs
Olive Oil
Salt
Pepper

Instructions:
Put water on to boil. When the water is boiling, add salt and pasta. The spaghetti will take about 12 mins to cook, leaving you time to prepare the sauce.
Heat some olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion and pancetta/guanciale and cook slowly
While this is cooking, break open the eggs into a small dish, and beat until you have a yellow mixture. Add some ground black pepper.
When the pasta is cooked, drain it and add it back to your saucepan - add the guanciale/onion to the pasta, and then finally add the eggs, and stir. The pasta should be hot enough to start cooking the raw egg mixture. Your aim is to stir it until you reach a midway between the egg being too cooked (dry) and being too raw (runny).

Optional extra - add some chilli pepper to the guanciale/onion.
